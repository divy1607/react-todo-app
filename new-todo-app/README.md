# Todo Application using React

This is a todo application using just frontend. Without integration of any backend in it. Which means that there is no method to save file in the local storage.
React for frontend and Material UI (mui) for extra components (CSS components).
However, app is really fast and easy to use with minimum number of components and code as well
